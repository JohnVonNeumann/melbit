### Why are we doing this project?
> Tom, Baxter and myself are junior developers who like the characteristics of crytpocurrencies, their massive benefits as an alternative source of asset control and the culture of tech. We recently attended a bitcoin meetup, then shortly after, Rails Camp 2016 where we decided we wanted to work on a small project that would give us valuable experience, and interested all of us. Bitcoin was something that we all found super interesting, so after some browsing, we decided that a bitcoin directory specifically for melbourne would be a good project for us.

### How are we planning to do this project?
> Our experience thusfar is short, at the time of writing this, we are all students at Coder Factory Academy in Melbourne, most of our experience is in Ruby/Rails so our plan is to leverage this knowlege for the entire project.

####Implementation 1: Simple web application layout and map view.
* Create a mobile friendly front page that offers a search bar, drop down menu and sitemap footer.
* Implement the OpenStreetMaps API.
* Enable users to search for locations (street names, addresses, listed businesses).

####Implementation 2: Improvement of map filtering.
* Enable the use of filters (types of businesses: Cafes, Restaurants, Bars, etc)

### What are our aims for this project?
> Our aims are simple, we belive this project will improve our development skills, we believe this project will provide a lot of benefit to the community, and we believe that this project will give us some great experience with team development practices.
